# flutter_e_portfolio

## Getting Started

To participate you will need to install Flutter (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
I recommend the use of Visual Studio Code but you can use other IDEs when you are more familiar with them and they support flutter/dart.
Please also set up a virtual or hardware device for testing your app.
I recommend creating an emulated android device, which can be created in the AVD manager of Android Studio.

As a starting point for the practical programming part you can clone the master branch of this repository.
You can also check out the solution branch when you have difficulties keeping up.
